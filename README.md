# **ðŸ“± Application Focus: Daily Task Organizer**

A ChatGPT-powered assistant that helps users:
- Create tasks
- Prioritize them
- Set reminders
- Suggest time blocks
- Reflect on task completion

---

# **ðŸš€ Development Progression Stages**

## **Stage 1: Simple Prompt (Static)**

**Prompt Example**:  
`"List 5 things I need to do today."`

**Output**:
- Buy groceries  
- Finish report  
- Call mom  
- Walk the dog  
- Read for 30 minutes  

**Limitations**:
- No prioritization  
- No time management  
- No context awareness

---

## **Stage 2: Structured Prompt with Parameters**

**Prompt Example**:  
`"Organize my tasks into high, medium, and low priority. Tasks: [Finish project, Wash car, Call client, Meditate, Submit tax forms]."`

**Output**:
High Priority:

Finish project

Submit tax forms

Call client

Medium Priority:

Meditate

Low Priority:

Wash car

## **Stage 3: Time-Aware Prompting**

**Prompt Example**:  
`"I have 4 hours today. Help me schedule these tasks: [Write blog post - 2h, Call team - 30m, Lunch - 1h, Email replies - 1h]."`

**Output**:
9:00â€“11:00 â€“ Write blog post
11:00â€“11:30 â€“ Call team
11:30â€“12:30 â€“ Lunch
12:30â€“1:30 â€“ Email replies

**Advancement**:
- Time management logic
- Simulates daily planner

## **Stage 4: Context-Aware Prompting**

**Prompt Example**:  
`"Today is Friday. I have meetings from 10â€“12 and 2â€“3. I want to finish a design task (2h) and relax in the evening. Suggest a balanced schedule."`

**Output**:
8:00â€“10:00 â€“ Design task (Part 1)
10:00â€“12:00 â€“ Meetings
12:00â€“1:00 â€“ Lunch
1:00â€“2:00 â€“ Design task (Part 2)
2:00â€“3:00 â€“ Meetings
3:00â€“5:00 â€“ Free/Buffer time
Evening â€“ Relaxation (Movie, Walk, etc.)

**Advancement**:
- Contextual planning
- Personalized suggestions

## **Stage 5: Multi-Turn Dialogue & Feedback Loop**

**Prompt Flow**:

User:  
`"Plan my Saturday. I want to work for 4 hours, spend time with family, and do something outdoors."`

ChatGPT:  
`"Got it! What time do you want to start your day and end it?"`

User:  
`"Start at 8 AM, done by 8 PM."`

**Final Output**:
8:00â€“12:00 â€“ Work session
12:00â€“2:00 â€“ Lunch + family time
2:00â€“4:00 â€“ Outdoor activity (park walk, biking, etc.)
4:00â€“6:00 â€“ Relax or errands
6:00â€“8:00 â€“ Dinner with family

- **Frontend UI**: Text input, task list (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Backend**: ChatGPT API with prompt templates
- **Task Storage**: Local storage or database
- **Optional**: Speech-to-text input
- **Reflection Prompts**:  
  `"What did I complete today, and what should I improve tomorrow?"`

---

# **âœ… Outcome: Functional Prompt-Based App**

**Features**:
- Smart scheduling
- Priority classification
- Contextual task planning
- Conversational interface

**Impact**:
- Real-world productivity tool
- Demonstrates prompt evolution
- Great for education, demos, or prototyping
